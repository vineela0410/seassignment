About Myself:
Hello everyone,
I am Vineela Reddy Tekula, currently pursing my master’s in computer science. I 
believe pursing master’s in computer science further develop my skills in system 
analysis, problem-solving and developmental research.
I learned languages such as C/C++, Python, Java, Html, JavaScript and SQL. I 
completed the Developer Program Training conducted by Accenture that gave me 
the opportunity to work on realistic tasks.
I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Sri Indu 
College of Engineering and Technology in 2022.
Thank you.
